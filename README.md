TerraFirmaTweaker

TerraFirmaTweaker is a standalone module split off from ModTweaker. ModTweaker is an addon for MineTweaker 3. Minetweaker lets you adjust recipes, remove them entirely, or add new recipes. While it has decent mod support, there are many mods that use custom crafting handlers that are not supported natively. TerraFirmaTweaker provides additional support for Terrafirmacraft.
